war game: red dragon
- RTS+cards
- summon early or stronger later
show cards w/o cost

# cards in deck, see all, choose n

nebulous fleet command - power budgets

Deck ideas
- overstatted vanilla creatures attack forward only
- command center spells

- shrapnel bot
- on hit: gain damage
- cheap healer



Use placement matters more.
count copies of the same bot (tesla coil bot, charging each other bot)
count times another ability has been used (powering up a sacrifice demon)


go make vanilla beaters with variable types and resistances

actions shouldn't cancel each other

(playtesting deckbuilding) board wipes to reset snowballing

mining = 2-axis who's the beatdown
- opens more deck archetypes
- interesting, but doesn't fix snowballing
- board space on back row limits pacifist archetypes

need some number of axes to get ahead on so falling behind in one isnt fatal (mtg has cards, mana, life, board)

attacks restricted to only directly in front could prevent snowballing

what does an aggro deck look like????

we played a game!!!

abilities cost too much
summon repeatedly before anything actually happens
free units too good
